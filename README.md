# Tiqiti App
## Description
-	A full stack Uber-like mobile application prototype for public transport buses within metropolitan areas. The application was developed in Java using android studio for android devices.
-	Passenger selects their destination from their current location as shown in the map, directions to the destination are displayed, the app then displays the buses going that route, how far they are from the passenger, the number of available sits and the sacco the bus belongs to.
-	On confirmation of payment, a sit is reserved in the upcoming selected bus and a QR code is generated with the necessary details for the conductor to scan.
-	When a ticket is reserved the bus conductor and driver will be notified of a passenger to be picked at a certain point along the way. On boarding the conductor scans the QR code to confirm its validity.
-	All QR codes once used cannot be reused again to avoid people cheating.
-	On reaching a bus stage the conductor and driver will be notified of the number of passengers who are getting off and those that are boarding. 
-	Made use of Google Maps API for mapping locations, routes, time and distance calculations from departure to destination points.
